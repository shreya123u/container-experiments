<h1>Docker Experiment 2: Binary Classification WebApp with Streamlit</h1><br>
<h2>Welcome to Docker Experiment 2!</h2> <br><p>This project demonstrates the power of Docker to containerize a machine learning web application built using Streamlit. The app classifies mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on input features, utilizing machine learning classifiers.</p><br>

<h3>🚀 Project Overview</h3>
<p>This is a Binary Classification WebApp designed to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using machine learning models. The app offers a selection of classifiers, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<p>Interactive UI built with Streamlit for classification and visualization.
Multiple Classifiers: Choose between SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
Evaluation Metrics: View Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve.
Dockerized App: Easy deployment and isolated environment.</p><br>
<h3>📝 Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker: Download and install Docker
Docker Compose: For managing multi-container Docker applications.
