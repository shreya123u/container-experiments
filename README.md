🐳 container-experiments: My Containerized Creations ⚓
Welcome to container-experiments! 🌊 This repository is my personal harbor of containerized projects, where I explore Docker to build scalable, efficient, and production-ready applications. 🛠️💡 Each project showcases a different aspect of containerization, from simple image creation to complex multi-container setups. 🚀

📦 Containerized Projects on Board:

1. DOCKER BASICS: Hello, Container World! 🐳

Goal: Kickstart my Docker journey by running the classic "Hello World" container.
Key Focus: Understanding basic Docker commands, image execution, and container runtime.



2. Dockerized Streamlit Development Environment 📊

Goal: Build a containerized Streamlit environment for smooth and efficient data visualization.
Key Focus: Web app deployment, interactive UI, and container efficiency.



3. Titanic Survival Predictor: Containerized Streamlit App 🚢

Goal: Deploy a Machine Learning-powered Titanic survival prediction app using Streamlit and Docker.
Key Focus: ML model serving, interactive UI, and cloud deployment.



4. Containerized MySQL: Agile & Efficient 🐬

Goal: Deploy MySQL in a Docker container, ensuring fast, reliable, and persistent database management.
Key Focus: Data persistence, networking, and security.



5. Docker Volume Persistence: Bind Mounts with Linux Containers 🗂️

Goal: Ensure data persistence and prevent loss by using Docker volumes and bind mounts.
Key Focus: Storage management, Linux containers, and backups.



6. Docker Bridge: Balancing Isolation & Connectivity 🔗

Goal: Master Docker bridge networks to create a balance between container isolation and seamless connectivity.
Key Focus: Multi-container communication, secure networking, and efficiency.



7. Streamlit & PostgreSQL, Docked 🐘

Goal: Connect Streamlit with PostgreSQL inside a containerized environment for real-time data interaction.
Key Focus: Full-stack integration, database handling, and scalable applications.



8. Evidently AI Sets Sail in Docker 🧠

Goal: Run Evidently AI inside a Docker container to analyze ML model performance and detect data drift.
Key Focus: AI model monitoring, automation, and analytics.



9. Minikube with Docker on Windows ☸️

Goal: Set up Minikube with Docker on Windows for running Kubernetes clusters locally in a Docker container.
Key Focus: Kubernetes management, local cluster setup, and Docker integration on Windows.




10. Deploying a Streamlit App in Docker on AWS EC2🐬

Goal: Deploy a Streamlit application inside a Docker container on an AWS EC2 instance, making it accessible via a public URL.
Key Focus: Containerization,EC2 Setup,Docker Deployment,Networking,Scaling & Automation




11. Microservices Orchestration with Minikube and Kubernetes ☸️

Goal: Deploy and manage microservices using Minikube and Kubernetes, enabling efficient container orchestration, scaling, and service discovery in a local development environment.
Key Focus: Minikube for a local Kubernetes cluster, and defining deployments, services, and pods using YAML. Kubernetes handles service discovery, load balancing, autoscaling, and rolling updates, ensuring efficient management and scalability. 



12. Microservices Architecture using Docker Swarm 🐘

Goal: Implement a scalable and resilient microservices architecture using Docker Swarm, enabling seamless container orchestration, service discovery, and load balancing across multiple nodes.
Key Focus: Docker Swarm simplifies container orchestration by clustering multiple Docker hosts into a single virtual system.



13. Bakery Foundation Example on Windows 🚀

Goal:Set up and run the Bakery Foundation Example on Windows, demonstrating the fundamentals of a bakery ordering system using microservices, event-driven architecture, and containerization.
Key Focus: The focus is on event handling, service orchestration, and scalability, ensuring smooth order processing and real-time updates.


Why container-experiments? ⚓

🚀 Goal: To master containerized applications, networking, storage, and deployments for real-world use cases.
🔬 Approach: Hands-on learning with modular, scalable, and production-ready implementations.
