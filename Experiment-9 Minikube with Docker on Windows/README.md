<h2>What is Minikube?</h2>
<p>Minikube is a tool that helps you run a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine. It's perfect for developers who want to experiment with Kubernetes without setting up a large cloud infrastructure. Minikube provides a simple way to start a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine, and it works with various drivers like Docker, VirtualBox, and Hyper-V.</p>

<br>Minikube makes Kubernetes accessible for local development, testing, and experimentation. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters locally without the need for extensive resources.

<h2>What is Kubernetes? ☸️</h2>
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It orchestrates and manages containers (such as those created with Docker) to ensure that applications run reliably and efficiently, whether in a development, test, or production environment.</p>

<br>Kubernetes allows you to:

<br>eploy applications in containers across clusters.
<br>Scale applications up or down with ease.
<br>Manage containerized workloads with minimal effort.
<br>Ensure high availability, load balancing, and fault tolerance for your applications.
<br>By using Kubernetes, developers can focus on writing code and let Kubernetes manage the complexity of application deployment and scaling.
